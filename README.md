# EvilPortal
Evil Portal is a captive portal module for the [Hak5](https://www.hak5.org) [Wifi Pineapple](https://www.wifipineapple.com/). This is the repository for the [Wifi Pineapple Nano](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=81044992) and [Wifi Pineapple Tetra](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=11303845317). If you have a Wifi Pineapple MKV you can find the code for that version [here](https://github.com/frozenjava/evilportal).

## Overview

### Basic Portals
Basic Portals allow you to create a simple captive portal page that is the same for everyone who visits it. This is useful if your needs don't involve different clients seeing different branded pages or pages with unique functionality to them.

### Targeted Portals
Targeted Portals allow you to create different portals to target a specific device or groups of devices based upon your pre-defined conditions. This is incredibly useful if you want all android devices to go to one android themed portal and all clients who are connected to "some-coffee-shop-wifi" go to a different portal all together. Targeted portals currently let you create targeting rules based on mac addresses, ssids, hostnames, and http useragents all on a per-client basis. You can either specify exact string matches or regex matches.
