# EvilPortal
Evil Portal is a captive portal module for the [Hak5](https://www.hak5.org) [Wifi Pineapple](https://www.wifipineapple.com/). 

This is a clone of the repository [EvilPortalNano](https://github.com/frozenjava/EvilPortalNano) for the [Wifi Pineapple Nano](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=81044992) and [Wifi Pineapple Tetra](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=11303845317). 

If you have a Wifi Pineapple MKV you can find the code for that version [here](https://github.com/frozenjava/evilportal).

## Overview
This version of the portal is able generate tokens and send those via mail (from template) and verifies those later.
This brings new abilities.

## Requires you to setup:

--> smtp settings on your pinapple. (smtp server infos needed)

--> edit details of sender and subject of the mail in the MyPortal.php. (The sender and Subject for the user token mail)

--> if needed replace the template.html (email template with your own | the template needs to have a string "TOKEN" !)

## Normal flow : 
User connects ---> enters email / pw ---> Internet

## New possible flow: 
User connects ---> enters email / pw ---> portal sends token ---> User enters Token ---> Internet

## Portals
### Basic Portals
Basic Portals allow you to create a simple captive portal page that is the same for everyone who visits it. This is useful if your needs don't involve different clients seeing different branded pages or pages with unique functionality to them.

### Targeted Portals
Targeted Portals allow you to create different portals to target a specific device or groups of devices based upon your pre-defined conditions. This is incredibly useful if you want all android devices to go to one android themed portal and all clients who are connected to "some-coffee-shop-wifi" go to a different portal all together. Targeted portals currently let you create targeting rules based on mac addresses, ssids, hostnames, and http useragents all on a per-client basis. You can either specify exact string matches or regex matches.

### Token Portals
Token Portals are Basic Portals with ability to generate tokens and send those via mail, those user based tokens will be request later to login. (sure will still ask for email and password !).

## Manual Installation

First clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/frozenjava/EvilPortalNano.git
```

Next change directory to EvilPortalNano

```
cd EvilPortalNano
```

Finally, with your Wifi Pineapple connected upload the EvilPortal directory to the Wifi Pineapple to the /pineapple/modules directory.

```
scp -r EvilPortal root@172.16.42.1:/pineapple/modules/
```

# Now you need to setup your SMTP Settings on your pinapple:
(you can ssh and edit the files or use the [Cabinet Module](https://github.com/hak5/wifipineapple-modules/tree/master/Cabinet)) 

```
edit the /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf and change it with your configuration.
For example, configuration for GMAIL:
root@Pineapple:/etc/ssmtp# cat ssmtp.conf
#
# /etc/ssmtp.conf -- a config file for sSMTP sendmail.
#
# The person who gets all mail for userids < 1000
# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
root=your_email@gmail.com

# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required
# no MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
# The example will fit if you are in domain.com and your mailhub is so named.
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465

# Where will the mail seem to come from?
rewriteDomain=gmail.com

# The full hostname
hostname=mail.gmail.com

# Set this to never rewrite the "From:" line (unless not given) and to
# use that address in the "from line" of the envelope.
FromLineOverride=YES

# Use SSL/TLS to send secure messages to server.
UseTLS=YES
#UseSTARTTLS=Yes

AuthUser=your_email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_gmail_password

# Use SSL/TLS certificate to authenticate against smtp host.
#UseTLSCert=YES

# Use this RSA certificate.
#TLSCert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssmtp.pem
```
# Edit Email details matching your needs:
```
edit MyPortal.php and change:
$sub = "Google FI - Your WIFI-Token !\nContent-Type: text/html"; //Subject of the mail & html format info just replace "Google FI - Your WIFI-Token !"
$sender = "your_email@gmail.com or your_fake_sender_email@gmail.com"; //Sender of the mail
```


# Change Nginx Servers to support hotspot auto detection on all devices.
# EDIT to / Override  /etc/nginx/nginx.conf with :

```
user root root;
worker_processes  1;

    worker_connections  1024;
