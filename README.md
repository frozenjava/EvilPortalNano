# EvilPortal
Evil Portal is a captive portal module for the [Hak5](https://www.hak5.org) [Wifi Pineapple](https://www.wifipineapple.com/). This is the repository for the [Wifi Pineapple Nano](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=81044992) and [Wifi Pineapple Tetra](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=11303845317). If you have a Wifi Pineapple MKV you can find the code for that version [here](https://github.com/frozenjava/evilportal).

## Overview

### Basic Portals
Basic Portals allow you to create a simple captive portal page that is the same for everyone who visits it. This is useful if your needs don't involve different clients seeing different branded pages or pages with unique functionality to them.

### Targeted Portals
Targeted Portals allow you to create different portals to target a specific device or groups of devices based upon your pre-defined conditions. This is incredibly useful if you want all android devices to go to one android themed portal and all clients who are connected to "some-coffee-shop-wifi" go to a different portal all together. Targeted portals currently let you create targeting rules based on mac addresses, ssids, hostnames, and http useragents all on a per-client basis. You can either specify exact string matches or regex matches.

## Manual Installation

First clone the repo and checkout the development branch

```
git clone https://github.com/frozenjava/EvilPortalNano.git
git checkout -b development origin/development
git pull
```

Next change directory to EvilPortalNano

```
cd EvilPortalNano
```

Finally, with your Wifi Pineapple connected upload the EvilPortal directory to the Wifi Pineapple to the /pineapple/modules directory.

```
scp -r EvilPortal root@172.16.42.1:/pineapple/modules/
```

Head on over to the Wifi Pineapples Web Interface and go to the Evil Portal module. You're all done!



## Smtp / sendmail Installation
You need to edit the /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf and change it with your configuration.
For example, configuration for GMAIL (less secure apps enabled):
```
root@Pineapple:/etc/ssmtp# cat ssmtp.conf
#
# /etc/ssmtp.conf -- a config file for sSMTP sendmail.
#
# The person who gets all mail for userids < 1000
# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
root=your_email@gmail.com

# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required
# no MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
# The example will fit if you are in domain.com and your mailhub is so named.
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465

# Where will the mail seem to come from?
rewriteDomain=gmail.com

# The full hostname
hostname=mail.gmail.com

# Set this to never rewrite the "From:" line (unless not given) and to
# use that address in the "from line" of the envelope.
FromLineOverride=YES

# Use SSL/TLS to send secure messages to server.
UseTLS=YES
#UseSTARTTLS=Yes

AuthUser=your_email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_gmail_password

# Use SSL/TLS certificate to authenticate against smtp host.
#UseTLSCert=YES

# Use this RSA certificate.
#TLSCert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssmtp.pem
```
